Before I made the big decision to quit my job at 45 and to go back to the university to follow a M.Sc. program in data science, I have been following online data science trainings (MOOCs) and I would like to share my experience with this in this blog.  

# First: Coursera

The first platform I started with is **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)** with the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) track **John Hopkins University**...  

With Coursera, I followed several courses. I started with the [Data Scientist’s Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools) which was my first introduction to the R language and to Github. I htink it was a great intro course for me and one thing it was really good at was to explain step by step how to get into R, RStudio and Github.

The second course I took was [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming). This is really the course that gave me the basics of programming with R. One good thing is that the programs contains exercises and assignments that are corrected by peers.

Then I followed with other courses: [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning) and [Exploratory Data Analsysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis), still from the Data Science specialization from John Hopkins.

I then switched to courses from **Illinois University**. I followed the [Data Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datavisualization) course which was realy interesting because it gave some theoretical background about what kind of visualization better suits some specific problems. The course also has a strong section on graph with nodes and edges to display relationships. 

Finally, I concluded my journey with Coursera and Illinois University by the [Text Retrieval and Search Engines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/text-retrieval) course. It was great as it was the first time I really learnt something about text mining... However, the course was quite difficult to follow, at least for a non native english speaker. I started the next course in the track (Text Mining and Analytics), but I stopped at about 80%.


# A fresh way to learn: DataCamp

For me, it was not a very difficult choice to drop from Coursera when I discovered the **[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)** platform... and Indeed, the first courses I started were "Intro to Python for Data Science" and "Intermediate Python for Data Science", before I realised it was probably a better choice to consolidate my knowledge of R before investing into learning another popular data science language.

DataCamp really nailed it! Not only the courses are very interesting and engaging, but the learning platform itself is great. It has an integrated engine that allows to program in python, R or SQL direclty inside the platform. If you don't know it, test it, this is a great way to learn. The courses can be taken independently but are also organized in skill tracks (4 to 6 courses related to a specific topic) and in carreer tracks (which are much longer). As of today, I have compleded the [Data Scientist with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-r) career track (23 courses) and 3 skill tracks: [Machine Learning with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-r) (4 courses), [Time Series with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/time-series-with-r) (6 courses) and [Text Mining with R]() (4 courses). In total I have followed 44 courses and I am not planning to stop anytime soon as DataCamp is so great.

My only (minor) complaint to DataCamp is that, generally, the datasets used in the course are given in the course dashboard, but that is not always the case... So if you try to take notes with a R notebook for instance, it is sometime frustrating because of this.


# Books

Some books also provide a very practical learning experience. I would cite in particular the [Deep Learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r) book from François Chollet and J.J. Allaire. The book is great as it starts from scratch and brings knowledge very gradually through practical examples that can be implemented easily by the reader. This is a also a great learning ressources!
